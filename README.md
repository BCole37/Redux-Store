# 22 State Homework: Redux Store

## Project Detials
To refactor a a e-commerce platform that is currently using Reactâ€™s Context API to use Redux

# Why
To demonstrate profeciency with React and an understanding of the Global context API by changing it to Redux. 
Also to obtian familiarity to Redux as it is the current industry standard.

# Problems Solved
use a Redux store instead of the Context API
a Redux provider
the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API

# Problems
Connecting to the mongodb due to having a special character in the password which broke it. This is the only real problem I encountered as the miniproject was very helpful.
